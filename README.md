# Pug Boilerplate

A boilerplate setup for projects using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to compile [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) into HTML and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) into CSS.



## Getting Started

Note: This is a template repository. New projects using this repo as a template should be created using the "repository template" option on the [Create a New Repository](https://github.com/new) page.

### Dependencies
* Node & npm
* Gulp 4

### Installation
1. If you haven't already, [use nvm to install node and npm](https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk)
2. If you haven't already, globally install the gulp command line tools: `npm install --global gulp-cli`
3. Clone this repo
4. In the project folder, install the node package dependencies: `npm install`

### Development
Run the default Gulp task (`gulp` or `gulp default`) in the project root to compile all files, watch for future changes, and start up [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/).
